AweCMS Bootstrap
================

AweCMS Bootstrap is a [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) boilerplate theme which incorporates [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
AweCMS Bootstrap should be used to create a new CakePHP theme. AwCMS Bootstrap was written for [AweCMS Tools](#) but it can also be used as stand alone package.

Usage
-----

There is 2 ways to use AweCMS Bootstrap at the moment:

1. Easy: [Download the latest release](https://github.com/AweCMS/AwecmsBootstrap/zipball/master) and upload it to APP/Views/Themed/NewThemeName
2. Less easy: Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git APP/Views/Themed/NewThemeName`

If you plan to use LESS you should use option 2 followed by:

    git submodule update --recursive
